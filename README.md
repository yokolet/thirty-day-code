# thirty-days-code

This repository was created to practice Clojure.
All here are problem solving at HackerRank. HackerRank is one of, or
only one, problem solving platforms which support Clojure.

The problems are from
[30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code).
This section has quite simple problems, so it's good to get started.

## Usage

0. Install `Java`
